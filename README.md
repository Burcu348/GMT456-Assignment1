## Software Development Lifecycles(SDLC)
- The Agile Model is a software development approach that prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback throughout the software development process. It focuses on delivering working software in small, frequent iterations, often referred to as sprints, and continuously adapting to evolving requirements. The importance of the Agile Model lies in its ability to respond to the dynamic nature of software development and the ever-changing needs of users. It offers a way to deliver high-quality software that aligns with customer expectations and remains adaptable to shifting requirements. Agile model has some advantages like flexibility, adaptability, user-centric design, and shorter development cycles. These make Agile a popular choice for software that evolves over time. <br/> 
- When choosing an SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) model for a QGIS plugin development project with PyQGIS, it must be considered the specific requirements, constraints, and characteristics of the project. Agile models are often a good fit for QGIS plugin development if our project has evolving requirements and a need for frequent user feedback. Agile emphasizes regular interaction with users and stakeholders, ensuring that the plugin addresses the specific requirements and desires of geospatial professionals. QGIS plugins vary in complexity. Agile's iterative approach allows you to break development into manageable iterations, making it easier to prioritize features based on user feedback. In my opinion, Agile Model is the best option to use in our term project for these reasons.
